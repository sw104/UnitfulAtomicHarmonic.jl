# UnitfulAtomicHarmonic

This package extends the
[Unitful.jl](https://github.com/PainterQubits/Unitful.jl) package to make
working in harmonic oscillator units on atomic systems easier.

Inspired by [UnitfulAtomic.jl](https://github.com/sostock/UnitfulAtomic.jl) by
[Sebastian Stock](https://github.com/sostock) and borrows aspects of this
package's structure.

This package is still in development and is liable to change significantly
without notice. Use at your own risk.
